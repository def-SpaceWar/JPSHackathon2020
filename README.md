# JPS Hackathon 2020

This is the github repo for the JPS Hackathon 2020 project.

If you do download this and want to develop on it run:

`npm install` to install the dependancies and

`npm start` to run the server

else if you want to just play it go to you're file explorer/finder/files (nautilus) or whatever you use to search files and go to the place where you downloaded the project and enter the "src" folder and then double click on the "index.html" which might appear as "index" and then it should open you're default browser with the game open!

The blue square (player 1) controls are e, s, d, f, q to move up, left, down, right, punch respectively.
The red square (player 2) controls are arrow keys and m to punch.
