# JPS Hackathon 2020: Cuboid Fight

This is the github repo for the JPS Hackathon 2020 project. To download the files click the Green Code button and download as a ZIP. After that unpack the zip using whatever arhchive manager of you're choice, ZIP format is built-in on Windows and Mac.

If you want to play it go to you're file explorer/finder/nautilus or whatever you use to search files and go to the place where you downloaded the project and enter the "src" folder and then double click on the "index.html" which might appear as "index" and then it should open you're default browser with the game open!

The blue square (player 1) controls are e, s, d, f, q to move up, left, down, right, punch respectively.
The red square (player 2) controls are arrow keys and m to punch.

(You have infinite jumps unless you're falling down!)

You can die by getting punched too much or getting knocked out of the map!
